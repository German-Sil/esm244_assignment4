# Overview:

This report looks at text from the first chapter of the _Wetlands_ textbook by . The text is analyzed to visualize the most common words used throughout the text and text sentiment analysis (is wetland science a positive or negative topic?). 

```{r setup, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

# attach libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(textdata)
library(pdftools)
library(ggwordcloud)
```

# Most Common Words
```{r}
# read in the data

wetlands <- pdf_text(here::here("data", "wetlands_chapter_1.pdf"))

wetlands_lines <- data.frame(wetlands) %>% 
  mutate(page = 1:n()) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_split(wetlands, pattern = "\\n"))
```
